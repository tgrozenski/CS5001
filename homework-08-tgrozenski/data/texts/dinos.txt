this is my file about dinos,
      better clean this line up,            
Contrary to what many people think, not all dinosaurs lived during the same geological period. 
     Stegosaurus, for example, lived during the Late Jurassic Period, about 150 million years ago. 
		Tyrannosaurus rex lived during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 72 million years ago.

Homework 07: Document Statistics
===========================
Course:   CS 5001

PROVIDED CODE - no need to edit! 

It is very common to break the view into a different file. This allows a single spot
to edit client interaction. For example, i could change this file 
to use a GUI instead of the console, and the rest of the program would not need to change.

The "view" for document view.

    Gets input from the client until the word STOP is entered on a
    single line in all caps. Each line is added to a list, then the
    tuple is returned. The STOP word is not included in the tuple.

    Examples: (note doctest is not run on this due to input prompt)
       Assume the client enters the following:
       Hello
       World
       STOP

       A frog jumps into the pond—
       Splash! Silence again.

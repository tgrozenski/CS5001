I used the website https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ternary-operator-in-python/ to learn about the ternary operator. I was already familiar with the concept, I did not know how to implement it in python. I also used the mermaid.js site to learn how to create flowcharts in Markdown. I ended up looking at the python documentation for error handling at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html because I could not figure out how to filter out non numbers without filtering out the negative sign and settled for using a try except block.
